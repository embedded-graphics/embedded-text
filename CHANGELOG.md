0.5.0-beta.1 (2021-06-04)
==========================

## Changed:

 * **breaking** Replaced `{Horizontal, Vertical}TextAlignment` traits with `{Horizontal, Vertical}Alignment` enums. Vertical centering option has been renamed to `Middle`.
 * **breaking** Moved `VerticalOverdraw` and `HeightMode` to the `style` module.
 * **breaking** Replaced type-state `VerticalOverdraw`, `HeightMode` with an enum.
 * **breaking** Replaced `TextStyle::line_spacing` with `line_height`.
 * **breaking** Added `#[non_exhaustive]` to `TextBoxStyle`.
 * **breaking** Need to pass character style to text box constructors.
 * **breaking** Changed `TextBoxStyleBuilder` API to better align with embedded-graphics' `TextStyleBuilder`.
 * **breaking** Changed measurement of lines that only contain whitespace.
 * **breaking** (developer-facing) Simplified `HorizontalTextAlignment` API.
 * **breaking** (developer-facing) Split off `LineCursor` from `Cursor`.
 * **breaking** The `TabSize` type is now an enum and doesn't depend on a font.
 * **breaking** Raised MSRV to 1.43.
 * **breaking** Updated to embedded-graphics 0.7.
    Changes in embedded-graphics required changing the type signatures of almost every embedded-text type. For example, former `Font` and `PixelColor` type bounds have been replaced by `TextRenderer`, `CharacterStyle` and their `Color` associated type.
 * **breaking** Replaced `style::color::Rgb` with `embedded_graphics::pixelcolor::Rgb888`.
 * ANSI sequence support now requires the `ansi` feature which is enabled by default.

## Removed

 * **breaking** Removed benchmarks.
 * **breaking** Removed `prelude`.
 * **breaking** Removed `Rectangle` extensions.
 * **breaking** Removed deprecated `TextBoxStyleBuilder::{text_style, background_color, text_color, from_text_style, underlined, strikethrough}`. Use `TextBoxStyleBuilder::character_style` instead.
 * **breaking** (developer-facing) The following types and modules have been removed or hidden:
   * `rendering::ansi`, `rendering::cursor`, `rendering::character`, `rendering::decorated_space`, `rendering::line`, `rendering::line_iter`, `rendering::space_config`
 * Removed `TextBox::into_styled()`

## Fixed

 * `interactive_*` examples: fix accidental moving of bounding box.
 * `editor` example: cursor now doesn't stick to the text.
 * The `ansi` feature can now be used in `no_std` environments.

## Added

 * Added `TextBox::vertical_offset` and `TextBox::set_vertical_offset`.
 * Added `TextBoxStyle::paragraph_spacing` and `TextBoxStyleBuilder::paragraph_spacing`.
